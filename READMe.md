## TradtuneDB Tailwind Experiment

This is an experiment to see if we can add responsive design to tradtunedb by totally rewriting the css in tailwind. The pages are mocked-up in HTML.  At the moment I am considering only small devices (i.e. mobiles) and not tablets. 

I've no idea yet what to do with the metronome page - it uses HTML5 Canvas with dynamic effects and I don't know how best to scale it.
